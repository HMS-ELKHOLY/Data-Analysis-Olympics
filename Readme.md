## Key Insights for Presentation

I focused on distribution of :

- age
- height
- weight

and separated outliers by their sport for further analysis to find sports with different distribution 

I focused on frequency of players and started to generate several plots depending on :

- sex 
- year 
- medals 
- season
- height and weight
  - to reach that:
    -  women trend grew to be similar to men over winter season
    - most winning players prefect height ,weight and age
    - sports that are stopped in olympics like arts
